Provide the Gen AI Chat Prompts

1. Write a brief description and user instructions for a Shiny App, explores the cancer_sample dataset. App allow users to filter the data by radius_mean range and by diagnosis (B or M). Describe app dynamically updates a plot showing the counts of B and M diagnoses, provides an interactive table summarizing the diagnosis counts, and allows users to download both the plot and the table.

2. How to use filtered_data as a reactive dataset source. The chart section must include the png() and dev.off() functions, while the table section must include the write.csv() function. Provide me with a code example.

3. Why error on sourceUTF8(fullpath, envir = new.env(parent = sharedEnv)): 
  Error sourcing C:\Users\RICKYZ~1\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpGS2X2v\filed587a7a573

4. What is the difference between downloading PNG images and downloading CSV spreadsheets? How can files be automatically named? Is automatic naming simpler than manual naming by users?

5. For example, to deploy my BC Liquor demo application, I need to insert the path (i.e., the folder containing the app.R file). /Users/gracetompkins/Desktop/BCLiquor   When deploying the application, is it necessary to locate the corresponding folder or app.R file?

6. Generate an R barplot where bars are filled with the color 'steelblue' and the borders are set to 'white'. Sould I use the color code or just name.

7.How to delete an already deployed application, or how to update it

8. Why is there an error with the image, and why isn't the corresponding image displayed?


Provide a Reflection

GenAI is immensely helpful for learning programming languages, assisting me with simple coding tasks. I can now focus my time on creating more polished and coherent work, rather than wasting it on tedious debugging and repetitive code writing. GenAI has profoundly impacted my programming journey. Reflecting back to 2022, before AI's emergence, before AI existed, our coding education never focused on understanding data structures or enhancing our comprehension of code. Instead, we wasted countless hours hunting for missing dashes or brackets, scouring forums for explanations. This process was incredibly tedious and inefficient. While it did cultivate my research skills, I'd much rather have spent that time actually learning. AI has virtually replaced all coding forums. It can swiftly pinpoint what trouble I'm in, even if the code it suggests might still be incorrect. 

I hope that in the future, AI can replace the role of programmers. This would liberate humans from the meaningless role of code farmers, allowing them to engage in more meaningful creative work. It would also enable faster product iteration and development.
