# Cancer Sample Radius Mean Filter App

This R Shiny app called **"Cancer Sample Radius Mean Filter App"** allows users to explore the `cancer_sample` dataset from the `cancaer` package.  
The app helps users filter data by `radius_mean` and diagnosis type, and visualize the distribution of B and M diagnoses.  

There are three main features of this app:

- **FEATURE 1: Plot showing diagnosis counts**  
  A bar chart (histogram-like) showing the number of B and M diagnoses that updates dynamically with the selected `radius_mean` range and diagnosis filter. This allows users to make simple comparisons between B and M counts.

- **FEATURE 2: Table showing diagnosis counts**  
  An interactive table (using the DT package) that shows the exact counts of B and M diagnoses. The table updates dynamically with the selected filters, allowing precise inspection of the data.

- **FEATURE 3: Download functionality**  
  Users can download the plot as a PNG file and the table as a CSV file, so they can save or share the results.

You can test out the app for yourself at [[https://your_shinyapp_link_here.shinyapps.io]([https://your_shinyapp_link_here.shinyapps.io](https://x5q75m-ricky0zng.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3/))](https://x5q75m-ricky0zng.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3/)
